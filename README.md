# DSCP HyProof Client

This repository contains the front-end for the **HyProof** proof of concept project.

**HyProof**, aka **Hydrogen Proof** is the effort to deliver the DLT-based _MVP_ as part of the wider **HII Seed** initiative which aims to push the boundaries when it comes to building the socio-technical acceptability and business implications of a fully digitised UK certification infrastructure for verifiable hydrogen provenance ( e.g: green hydrogen, etc ).
